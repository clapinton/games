# Minesweeper for terminal

## Info
This is a project I worked on with @mnsapits. We built this over one day during the first week at AppAcademy. The main goal was to get more comfortable with recursion calls.

## Running
Just clone the repo and run `ruby game.rb`.

Input the difficulty level to start playing.

Select a position and your action.

As you sweep away, don't forget to flag suspicious positions:

And be careful with the bombs!
